# Open Community Hub (hub-core)

Open Community Hub is open-source software for coordinating local service, participation, and mutual support at the neighborhood/community level.

This project is designed to be:
- **Local-first**: each community can run its own hub.
- **Belief-neutral**: welcoming to churches, schools, nonprofits, civic groups, and individuals.
- **Supplemental**: intended to coexist with existing communities, not compete with them.
- **Easy to host**: a "hub-in-a-box" that can be deployed via Docker.

## What it does (MVP)
- A community bulletin board for **Needs** and **Opportunities**
- Volunteers can offer help and coordinate safely
- Organizations (churches/schools/nonprofits) can post service opportunities
- Moderation tools to keep hubs safe and usable

## Status
Early design + scaffolding. See:
- `docs/SPEC.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

## License
TBD (recommended: Apache-2.0 or MIT)

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or PR and keep changes aligned with the principles in `docs/SPEC.md`.
